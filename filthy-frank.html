<time>28 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2><span id=Filthy_Frank-_Biography>Filthy Frank- Biography</span></h2><p>He is a record producer, rapper, singer, songwriter, and former YouTube celebrity best known for his <strong>Filthy Frank</strong> YouTube channel. Later, he pursued a musical career, going by the stage name Joji.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Filthy_Frank_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Filthy Frank? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>As of 2022, reports estimate his <strong>net worth</strong> to be $1.5 million, earned primarily through a successful career in music and comedy, as well as a substantial amount of money from his YouTube career. It is projected that his wealth would expand as he continues his pursuits.</p><h2><span id=Filthy_Frank-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Filthy Frank- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>George Miller was born on September 18, 1992, in Osaka, Japan. Frank was raised in Osaka and is half-Australian, as his father is of Australian heritage. He enrolled in Canadian Academy in 2012 and graduated in 2013. Because of the nature of his YouTube channel, very little information about his life is available at this point, as he preferred to retain his seclusion. He then revealed that he was studying at college in Brooklyn, New York City, and didn’t want to reveal personal details in order to acquire a job later on. He also claimed that he had a lot of health issues and that he experienced seizures as a result of an ailment that he didn’t go into too much detail about.</p><h2><span id=Filthy_Frank-_Professional_Career>Filthy Frank- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Frank started off with a comedic sketch YouTube channel called DizastaMusic, which grew in popularity after he created the persona, Filthy Frank. His initial channel grew rapidly, acquiring 800,000 followers, but he would soon stop posting to it due to a slew of community and copyright strikes. Later, he launched the YouTube channel TVFilthyFrank, which quickly surpassed his initial channel in terms of subscribers. His Filthy Frank character was among the top 500 YouTubers, with over 5.2 million subscribers and 600 million views. He has started a third channel called TooDamnFilthy, which has nearly two million subscribers.</p><p>Aside from his comic material, he continued to work on his music creation, as he has a passion for music. He based his songs on Pink Guy, a character from the Filthy Frank program who featured musical content similar to that of his YouTube channel. He has published several albums, including “Pink Season,” “Pink Guy,” and “Pink Season: The Prophecy,” which have substantially increased his popularity. In 2017, he also debuted as Pink Guy for the first time.</p><h3><span id=Serious_Music_and_Joji>Serious Music and Joji</span></h3><p>Despite the popularity of his Filthy Frank character and his comic content with Punk Guy, he still wanted to create more serious and traditional music, so he took on another stage name – Joji – and began releasing music on the website SoundCloud. He stated that he began making music as a child in Japan and recognized that the popularity of his Pink Guy identity would pave the road for him to establish Joji. He planned to release his first serious album with Pink Guy’s album, but he postponed it since his fans wanted him to do funny music instead.</p><p>In 2017, he released numerous songs under the moniker Joji on the music label 88Rising, including “Will He,” “I Don’t Wanna Waste My Time,” and “rain on me.” He was also featured in the Higher Brothers’ song “Nomadic” and promoted his debut effort, an EP titled “In Tongues” that was published in late 2017, with a deluxe version the following year. His music has been described as a blend of techno, folk, trap, and R&B, and he has been likened to musician James Blake – he also states that his music was inspired by his childhood in Japan. In 2017, he said that he would stop producing comedy, including Filthy Frank, due to a lack of enthusiasm and poor health.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>While the Filthy Frank YouTube channel is no longer operational, and the lack of comedy content means that no Pink Guy projects will be released in the near future, he remains active online, particularly on social media platforms Instagram and Facebook, where he goes by the stage name Joji. He primarily utilizes his accounts to advertise upcoming projects, such as a tour with 88 Rising label signees. Despite the fact that he is no longer interested in generating comedic work, his Joji persona appears to retain some of his comedy qualities; he is still releasing singles through his label.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Shelby Holliday</a>, <a href=#>Yoon Chan Young</a>, and <a href=#>Hailey Peters</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Musician</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Height And Career Of Greg Laswell</a></h3>American musician and recording engineer Greg Laswell.
