世間的に知られてない曲がほとんどです。
それはやはり、GACKTさんのコアすぎる世界観が、

Nor the ceiling or the chair.
I'm eking weeks of peace at the beach
I see the breezes weave the trees,
These walls, you'll find, are yours and mine
Defined not by them, I
I'm in times that lie behind my eyelids,
The sunset still the rising silence,[Chorus:]
I'll not feel no fear
Cos' I'm not really here
I'm nowhere near here
There's no rain on roof that grates and beats me</description></item><item><title> Megan Fox doesnt look like herself with sultry pose in cut-out tiny bikini Mon 5 June</title><link>/megan-fox-doesnt-look-like-herself-with-sultry-pose-in-cut-out-tiny-bikini.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/megan-fox-doesnt-look-like-herself-with-sultry-pose-in-cut-out-tiny-bikini.html</guid><description>Megan Fox posted a bikini Instagram pic, sending fans wild and questioning whether she got BBL or a boob job.
