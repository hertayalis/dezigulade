世間的に知られてない曲がほとんどです。
それはやはり、GACKTさんのコアすぎる世界観が、
一般的にとっつきにくいからだと思います。
GACKTさんのアルバム曲というと、
興味ない人からすれば、
「は？」と思うかもしれませんが、
実は、シングル曲よりも聴きやすい名曲が多いのです。
今、フェスが好きでロキノン系バンドが好きな方なら、
GACKTさんのシングルよりもアルバム曲の方が好みかもしれません。

Sticking a screwdriver in the fan while it’s hot is a surefire way to tell if it’s shot. If the fan comes to a halt, the clutch is faulty. If the screwdriver is thrown back at you by the fan, the clutch is in good working order. When the vehicle is turned off, the fan should be able to be moved freely by hand.
