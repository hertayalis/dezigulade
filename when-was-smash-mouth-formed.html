(Freedom of Speech), founded Smash Mouth. Coleman, Harwell’s manager, introduced the talented guitarist Greg Camp and bassist Paul De Lisle, who had both previously played in a local punk band. With Kevin Coleman taking on the role of drummer, they began rehearsing together and soon transformed into a full-fledged band. They adopted the name “Smashmouth,” inspired by an American football term, and during their early years, they primarily played rock music.</p><p>The band’s initial breakthrough came when a San Jose radio station, KOME, played a demo of their song “Nervous in the Alley.” This led to their signing with Interscope Records, and in 1997, they released their debut album, “Fush Yu Mang,” which featured the addition of keyboardist Michael Klooster. As part of their transition to Interscope Records, the band officially became known as Smash Mouth.</p><p>The album achieved double platinum status, driven by the success of their first major single, “Walkin’ on the Sun.” They also released singles like “The Fonz” and a cover of “Why Can’t We Be Friends” from the 1998 film “Wild Things.”</p><p>From 1998 to 2004, <a href=# rel=noopener>Smash Mouth</a> experienced a surge in fame with albums like “Astro Lounge,” released in 1999. This album marked a shift towards a pop sound with less ska influence. Smash Mouth enjoyed widespread recognition with hit singles such as “All Star” and “Then the Morning Comes,” leading to “Astro Lounge” being certified triple platinum. They also released “The East Bay Sessions” in 1999, which was a collection of early songs. During this period, drummer Kevin Coleman left the band due to back problems, leading to a series of replacements, including Michael Urbano, Mitch Marine, and eventually Michael Urbano once again.</p><p>In 2001, Smash Mouth covered the Monkees’ hit song “I’m a Believer,” which was featured on the soundtrack for “Shrek” and their self-titled album. Despite selling fewer copies than their earlier works, the album achieved gold certification. Additionally, the band made a cameo appearance in the film “Rat Race” in the same year.</p><p>In 2003, they released “Get the Picture?” with singles like “You Are My Number One,” “Hang On,” and “Always Gets Her Way.” However, after the release of this album, Smash Mouth was dropped from Interscope Records. In the same year, they covered the Sherman Brothers’ song “I Wanna Be Like You” for the animated film “The Jungle Book 2.”</p><p>From 2005 to 2011, Smash Mouth went through various lineup changes and released their greatest hits compilation, “All Star Smash Hits,” in 2005. They also released a Christmas album titled “Gift of Rock” in December 2005. Their fifth studio album, originally intended to be called “Old Habits,” was eventually replaced by “Summer Girl” in 2006. This album featured remixed tracks from “Old Habits” and new songs.</p><p>Over the years, band members continued to change, with Greg Camp leaving and returning, and the inclusion of new members like Sean Hurwitz and Mike Krompass. In 2016, they released their first live album, “Playlist: The Very Best of Smash Mouth.” Their sixth studio album, “Magic,” arrived in 2012, produced primarily by Mike Krompass. The album’s first single, “Magic,” made its debut on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.</p><p>In 2020, Smash Mouth performed at the 2020 Sturgis Rally, where Steve Harwell expressed controversial sentiments regarding COVID-19 during the performance. In October 2021, following a performance at The Big Sip beer and wine festival in Bethel, New York, Harwell announced his retirement due to ongoing health issues. Zach Goode was recruited as the new lead singer in January 2022. Smash Mouth continued to release new music, including covers and original singles, in the years that followed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When was Smash Mouth formed?</h2><p>Smash Mouth was formed in the year 1994.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfnqZdrK60edKmmKygXaK8tsDHZp2oqp2asXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhen-was-smash-mouth-formed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhen-was-smash-mouth-formed.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhen-was-smash-mouth-formed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhen-was-smash-mouth-formed.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhen-was-smash-mouth-formed.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhen-was-smash-mouth-formed.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ralph-macchio-cobra-kai-lookalike-daughter-julia-macchio.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ralph-macchio-cobra-kai-lookalike-daughter-julia-macchio.html>Who is Ralph Macchio's lookalike famous daughter?
