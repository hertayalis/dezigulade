Forbes reported that of the $4 billion Stewart's 25 films have earned worldwide, 93% of it has come from The Twilight Saga.</p><p>Despite being tied to the saga, Stewart <a href=#>hopes to change that</a> with Spencer, as it has already thrown her into the Oscar circle following the release of the <a href=#>first footage</a> at CinemaCon.</p><p>"I just saw the teaser trailer for #Spencer & a 5 minute clip from the film," Film critic Scott Menzel&nbsp;said in a tweet. "Based on the footage, it looks like Kristen Stewart will be getting an Oscar nomination for her performance as Diana. I'm feeling very confident that this is going to be #KristenStewart's big moment."</p><p>Journalist Jason Guerrasio added in, "Just saw footage of SPENCER. Kristen Stewart is going all out for that Oscar glory. And her Princess Di accent is spot on! #CinemaCon."</p><p>Variety Awards Editor Clayton Davis predicts that this year's best actress circle will include:</p><p>Spencer is scheduled to be <a href=#>released</a> on November 5, 2021.</p><p>The 2022 Oscars will then be held on March 27, 2022.</p><h2>Who is Kristen Stewart engaged to?</h2><p>On November 2, 2021, Kristen confirmed to Howard Stern on the Howard Stern Show that&nbsp;<a href=#>Dylan Meyer had proposed to her.</a></p><p><a href=#>Dylan is an actress,</a> producer, and writer.</p><p>She is known for writing credits in films like Loose Ends and XOXO.&nbsp;</p><p>Dylan also worked on the TV series Miss 2059 and most recently, Rock Bottom, a short film released this past April.</p><p>Kristen and Dylan met on the set of a movie about six years ago.</p><p>Kristen told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Howard Stern Show</a>&nbsp;that she lost contact with Dylan after meeting on set but ran into each other at a mutual friend’s party and she was shocked.&nbsp;</p><p>“The day that I met her, it was like all bets were off,” Kristen said.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding: “I met her years ago on a movie and I hadn’t seen her in six years, and then she rocked up at a friend’s birthday party, and I was like, ‘Where have you been, and how have I not known you?’ She’s been living in L.A. alongside my life somehow but not ever converging.”</p><p>The pair quickly began dating and she confessed to Howard that she told Dylan she loved her two weeks later.&nbsp;</p><p>“The first time I told her I loved her, it was really late and we were in some shitty bar and her friends were there or whatever, and they walked out,” Kristen said, “and I was just like, ‘Oh, man, I’m so f**king in love with you.’ Like, done.”</p><p>Kristen seemed to have moved on fast from her breakup with model Stella Maxwell and she was photographed with Dylan in August of 2019.</p><p>She and Stella ended their relationship of two years in October 2018 but were caught sharing a smooch on a luxury yacht in July of 2019.</p><p>The actress dished on the proposal, saying: "We're marrying, we're totally gonna do it.</p><h2
