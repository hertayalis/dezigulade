Since the actor entered the world of the undead with a barbed wire-wrapped baseball bat, he has become a cultural phenomenon. Morgan has a lengthy resume that includes film and television roles, but his portrayal of Negan on the AMC smash hit show truly made him a household name, a character he has since returned to great acclaim in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Walking Dead: Dead City</a>.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=551 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>But before he became an actor, Jeffrey Dean Morgan’s talent was in basketball before an injury, pivoting his attention to graphic design and eventually acting, laying the groundwork for his current illustrious Hollywood career. Morgan’s first film role was in&nbsp;Uncaged&nbsp;in 1991. He spent the next decade appearing as a guest star on television shows such as&nbsp;ER,&nbsp;JAG, and&nbsp;Walker, Texas Ranger. However, it was his heartbreaking role as Denny Duquette on&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy&nbsp;from 2005 to 2006 that brought him widespread recognition.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>That same year, he also began playing John Winchester, the protagonists’ father, on&nbsp;Supernatural. Morgan left a lasting impression on the show, providing a multifaceted and fascinating character who fans adored despite his infrequent appearances. Years later, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a lead on a legendary series, a testimony to his brilliance and longevity as an entertainer. Let’s recall a few of his most impressive roles, shall we?</p><h2 id=h-10-the-possession-2012 data-injectable=false>10.&nbsp;The Possession&nbsp;(2012)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>The Jewish folktale of the “dybbuk box,” an object supposedly possessed by an evil spirit, inspired the horror film&nbsp;The Possession. Clyde Brenek, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, is a recently divorced father. Em, Clyde’s youngest daughter (played by Natasha Calis), buys an old box at a garage sale without realizing it’s the dybbuk box, a container for a demonic spirit.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>When Em’s behavior starts to change for the worse, Clyde and his ex-wife Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) must figure out what’s happening and how to save their daughter. Morgan’s Clyde is intriguing, straddling the line between a loving parent and a skeptic regarding his daughter’s sudden behavioral shift after their divorce. But as events progress and the supernatural components become more and more apparent, he transforms into a frantic father who will do anything to protect his daughter.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-9-p-s-i-love-you-2007 data-injectable=false>9.&nbsp;P.S.
