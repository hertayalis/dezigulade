Duncan was one of the show's most frequent guests, appearing a total of 18 times, and, the day after Duncan's death in September, Ferguson began his show with a tribute to him. In January 2013 during The Late Late Show' s winter break, reruns of the Scotland episodes were broadcast with a tribute to Duncan at the beginning of each of the five episodes, featuring Duncan on a pink background and the text "In memory of our friend <a href=#>Michael Clarke</a> Duncan."</p><p>On July 12, 2012, Duncan was taken to Cedars Sinai Medical Center after suffering a heart attack.
