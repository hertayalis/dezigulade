She had been dating someone for a while, and while everything was going great, she couldn’t help but feel like something was missing. Her partner was perfect on paper, but there was a certain spark that was missing from their relationship. She couldn’t shake off the feeling that she missed the way she used to love her ex, who was more volatile and impulsive in nature.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Lyrics></span>The Lyrics<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In the song’s opening verse, Taylor compares her stable and predictable current relationship to a “sweet and steady rush” of the past. She laments how everything feels too safe and mundane and how she misses the drama and passion of her previous relationship.</p><p>In the chorus, Taylor sings about how she wants her current partner to understand that she’s not happy with the way things are. She compares it to living in black and white when what she really wants is to feel alive again. The chorus perfectly captures the feeling of wanting something that’s just out of reach and not knowing how to get it back.</p><p>The second verse delves deeper into how Taylor feels stifled by her current relationship. She sings about how she feels like she’s walking on eggshells and has to “be careful what I say” around her partner. In contrast, she remembers how her ex would say whatever was on their mind, even if it may have been hurtful at times.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Meaning></span>The Meaning<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>At its core, “The Way I Loved You” is about wanting something that you know may not be good for you. Taylor Swift perfectly captures the struggle of trying to move on from someone you know is bad for you but can’t seem to forget.
