As an Asian child, Chan grew up in a household with strict rules, which eventually turned him into a conformist. From a very early age, the idea of being self-sufficient, respecting elders, and giving value to principles was inculcated in him.</p><p>But according to him, he couldn’t instill those values in his son Jaycee. In his book, Chan described how Jaycee used to be aloof around him. In fact, he once revealed his wish to donate his multimillion dollar fortune to charity and not keep anything for Jaycee. What could have made Chan contemplate this decision? Let’s find out.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Jackie Chan was not impressed with his son’s demeanor</h2><p>Though Chan was an obedient student and son throughout his life, he didn’t get the same in return. In fact, Jaycee was the opposite. As depicted in his book ‘Never Grow Up’, the Rush Hour actor shared, “I wished someone could train him to stand and sit properly, to stop fidgeting so much when he spoke, but if I tried, he’d stop talking to me”. He claimed that as his schooling was in the US, he did everything in an American way.</p><p>Staying away from each other, they couldn’t stop the gap between them from widening. <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Chan blamed himself</a> for this situation and shared how his work life kept his son away from him. The actor stated, “As a child, he got to see me only in the small hours of the morning…”. He continued, “I was always happy to spend time with him, but he seemed so unenthusiastic around me.” Indeed, Jaycee’s father almost missed his upbringing and was not happy with what he had become.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-us-sports-news-martial-arts-news-he-was-shooting-me-to-avenge-his-mother-jackie-chan-was-once-surprised-by-son-jaycees-bizarre-reaction?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/JChan-315x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">“He Was Shooting Me to Avenge His Mother”: Jackie Chan Was Once Surprised by Son Jaycee’s Bizarre Reaction</p></a><p>It was the rigid Chinese upbringing of the actor that made him a strict father who would discipline his son whenever he did something wrong. In fact, Chan wanted his son to find his own way in life and not depend on his money.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Chan declined his son to hold on to his legacy</h2><p>As a man of principles, the Vanguard actor had his own unusual way of teaching a lesson to his son. Pao Pao has taken the tougher way many times. In an interview, Chan once refused to hand over his $400 million worth fortune to his son Jaycee Chan.</p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Jackie-Chan-6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Evidently, the idea behind donating everything to charity was to make Jaycee learn the value of money and work hard work to earn the way of life as his father did. Chan couldn’t tolerate his son getting everything instantly and taking all the hard work for granted.</p><p>Watch This Story – <strong>&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>“Hero of mine”: Arnold Schwarzenegger bowed down tt he martial arts legend Jackie Chan during their iconic reunion in 2019</a></strong></p><p>Though Jackie was not impressed with Jaycee, as a responsible father, he always stood beside him in thick and thin.
