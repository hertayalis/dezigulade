The wedding took place in Detroit, Michigan, alongside 125 of their closest family and friends. Alaina’s sister Hailie Jade was a bridesmaid for the joyous occasion.</p><p>“June 9, 2023, simply one of the best days of my life🤍 in this lifetime and in the next, my soul will always find yours🌹,” Alaina <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">raved over her nuptials</a> on social media alongside snapshots of the event.</p><p>The beaming bride had her happiest day, but she lived through a troubled upbringing in her younger years. Her mother, Dawn Scott, battled drug addiction and later died in 2016 from a <a href=#>suspected heroin overdose.</a> Dawn is the twin sister of Kim Scott, Eminem’s ex-wife.</p><p>Dawn lambasted Eminem just months before she died, claiming that he never aided her with her issues.</p><p>“I have a millionaire brother-in-law and a sister with money up the ass, but they’re refusing to give me any help,” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RadarOnline</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Eminem’s daughter Alaina Scott married Matt Moeller on June 9, 2023. <span class=credit>Instagram/@alainamariescott</span></figure><p>Dawn was 41 years old at the time of her passing and her boyfriend Les Martin told the publication that she made desperate phone calls to Kim in the year before her death.</p><p>“I’ve been trying like hell to save her life,” Martin said. “I’ve had numerous conversations with Kim about trying to get her help and it just wasn’t a conversation she wanted to have. She wanted to let Dawn go.”</p><p>Like Alaina’s mother Dawn, Eminem had his own struggles with addiction. He has been <a href=#>sober</a> since 2007 after overdosing on methadone, and he credits his children with helping him stay on the straight and narrow. In 2010, he gave <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the New York Times</a>&nbsp;an interview about his battle with addiction.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Eminem’s ex-wife, Kim Scott, gave birth to his only biological daughter, Hailie, in 1995. <span class=credit>Corbis via Getty Images</span></figure><p>“I didn’t know it was methadone. I used to get pills wherever I could,”&nbsp;he said. “I was just taking anything that anybody was giving to me.”</p><p>The rapper added that his family has been supportive of his sobriety. “I love them so much and they’ve helped me through so many things,” he said.</p><p>Eminem is a father of three. While the “8 Mile” star — born Marshall Mathers — adopted Alaina and Stevie in the early 2000s, Hailie is his only biological daughter.</p><p><strong>Keep reading to learn more about Eminem’s three children.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alaina Marie Scott</h2><p>Alaina is the daughter of Kim’s twin sister, Dawn.
